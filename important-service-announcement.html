        <h6>Worona&#x27;s native mobile apps platform and services will not be available after October 20, 2018</h6>
        <div class="text">We have an important announcement to make. We are no longer providing updates or further feature development for Worona’s platform and mobile apps.<br><br>Worona is now closed for new signups, but existing free and premium users will continue to be able to use our platform and their mobile apps until <strong>October 20, 2018</strong>.<br><br>During this year-long period, customer support will be only provided to premium users. Our <a href="https://docs.worona.org/" target="_blank" class="text-link">documentation</a> and <a href="https://faq.worona.org/" target="_blank" class="text-link">FAQ’s page</a> will still be available to all users though.<br><br><strong>Worona Publish customers</strong> interested in transferring their mobile app from Worona’s developer account to a different one, please contact us so that we can help you out.</div>

        <h6>Why this decision?</h6>
        <div class="text">We launched Worona in 2015 in an effort to make it easy and affordable for people to build mobile apps and provide the best WordPress mobile experience out there. While the service has a loyal following, we are aware that mobile app usage is slowly declining, which might point to the end of the app boom.<br><br>Besides that, Apple published their new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" target="_blank" class="text-link">App Store Review Guidelines</a> with stricter rules regarding the App Store submissions a few months ago. In particular, updated guidelines specifically do not support apps using “a commercialized template or app generation services”. Every submission process started taking away vital resources and time from the team, which became a big inconvenience for us.<br><br>Unfortunately, we cannot find a profitable opportunity to grow under this scenario. We&#x27;re proud that we&#x27;ve been able to help so many of you build great mobile apps, but we need to focus our resources, time, and effort on new areas of growth.<br><br>While it’s sad to say goodbye to mobile apps, we’re eager to explore more ways to use our technology and make the mobile experience more compelling and relevant for their users.<br><br>We truly appreciate your continued support. Thank you for using Worona.<br><br><br>- Worona Team</div>

        <h6 class="announcement-h">FAQ</h6>
        <div class="text padding-bottom-30"><strong><br>Can my users continue using my mobile app?</strong><br><br>Yes, they can. But please note that your app will not be updated during this time and will no longer work after October 20, 2018. If you paid for our submission service and would like to transfer your app from Worona’s account to a different one, please contact us so that we can help you out.</div>
        <div class="text padding-bottom-30"><strong>During this year, can I still using your platform to build and customize apps?</strong><br><br>You can, but we do not recommend it. Our platform will not be updated during this time and will be shutted down after October 20, 2018.</div>
        <div class="text padding-bottom-30"><strong>What alternatives can I use now to build a mobile app?</strong><br><br>There is no exact replacement for Worona, but there are several solutions that offer a similar functionality. Popular choices include: <a href="#">AppPresser</a>, Mobiloud, Androapp, and WappPress.</div>
